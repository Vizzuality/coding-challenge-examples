# Full stack developer - frontend challenge

## Project boilerplate generator

Use the project boilerplate generator of your choice. You're free to use the one on this repo.

## Objective

Write a small frontend app that loads posts data from a csv file to display on a grid of cards. The attached posts.csv file contains image urls, titles and urls of posts. You can import the csv as a json/js object.

Each card should have the image and title linking to the post, and all cards should have the same height.

Please note: you don't need to include pagination and sorting as shown in the wireframe.

## Requirements

- Use ES6+ syntax;
- Use React or any other library of your choice (even no library at all) as long as you demonstrate a component oriented architecture.

## Data

[posts.csv](data/posts.csv)

## Wireframe
