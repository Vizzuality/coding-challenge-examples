# Full stack developer - backend challenge

Using Ruby on Rails we would like you to complete the following task.

The attached emissions.csv file contains CO2 emissions data, which need to be imported into the database (PostgreSQL). This data will be used to render filterable charts in the future, but the exact specification of that feature is not yet known. This is a sample dataset; the full dataset will be 10 times the size, but will follow the same format.

## Requirements:

- Use Active Record Migrations to create database objects;
- Use Active Record to create the models;
- Implement a rake task to import data from the csv file, from local file system.

There is no need to create a web interface; you won't need to write any controller or view code.

## Data

[emissions.csv](data/emissions.csv)
