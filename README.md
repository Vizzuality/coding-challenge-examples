# Vizzuality / BackEnd Challenge / Ruby


## 1. Instructions for completing and submitting the challenge:

First thing first. This coding challenge is about creating a space for you to share with us how you work and reason, what things you care about when doing coding work, and how you approach problem solving. As such, through this challenge we are not expecting to check if you know the finest algorithms, have all the right answers to a given situation or if you are the best coder in the world. We believe there are no right or wrong answers, so please make yourself comfortable and focus on what you know best.

## 2. This is what you need to do:

Using Ruby on Rails we would like you to complete the following task.

The attached emissions.csv file contains CO2 emissions data, which need to be imported into the database (PostgreSQL). This data will be used to render filterable charts in the future, but the exact specification of that feature is not yet known. This is a sample dataset; the full dataset will be 10 times the size, but will follow the same format.

## 3. Requirements:

- Use Active Record Migrations to create database objects;
- Use Active Record to create the models;
- Implement a rake task to import data from the csv file, from local file system.

There is no need to create a web interface; you won't need to write any controller or view code.

## 4. Data

[emissions.csv](data/emissions.csv)

## 5. Things to keep in mind:

- **Please submit your ideas to us in 1 week (max)**. This will give us enough time to review your challenge with the rest of the team before the next interview. 
- Based on previous candidate experiences, we believe **it will take you between 6 and 10 hours to complete the challenge**. If you see yourself allocating a lot more than that, you are including too much and/or overcomplicating it :)

## 6. So, I submit the challenge. What will happen during the interview?

- In the upcoming interview we will take some time to understand more about you, your skills, and your previous experiences that relate to this role. We’ll take some time to explore together your coding challenge submission, and will ask you any clarifying questions we might have. 
- This will also be an opportunity for you to provide some more context about the challenge, the assumptions you made, and add anything that you might want.
- Finally, we will also allocate some time for you to ask any questions about anything and everything you would like to know more about (ie. role, how we work at Vizzuality, our culture, benefits, etc.)
- The interview will last 120 minutes (max)


**“The Challenge” has been created with the sole intention of being used as a guiding document for the current recruitment process. This means we won't be using it (all or parts of it) within our projects.**
