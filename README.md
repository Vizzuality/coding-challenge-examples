## Project boilerplate generator

Use the project boilerplate generator of your choosing. You're free to use the one on this repo.

## Objective

Write a small frontend app that fetches photos data from an URL and displays them on a grid of cards. Each card should have the photo title, a link to the large version and a thumbnail. The grid should include pagination or lazy loading.

Include a button that lets you sort by title in ascending/descending order, and displays the current order. (See top right corner of the wireframe).

Make it look good, doesn't have to be very sophisticated.

## Requirements

* Use ES6+ syntax.
* Use React.
* Use Redux.
* Use the Container-Component pattern to connect the state from the store with the components.

## Bonus

* Use some form of modular/scoped css or CSS-in-JS solution.
* Include a loading spinner or placeholder.
* Describe any bottleneck or difficulties you might find.
